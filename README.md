# Repository for the PROG2002 Exam (Autumn 2022)

1. Do not clone/use this repository untitl the official start of the exam.
2. The information about the tasks to perform will be available on Inspera.
3. This repository comes with a set of issues that are asociated to the tasks to perform during the exam. The student *must* fill up the issue indicating the degree of completion of the task and comment on the solution implemented (simply use a comment on the corresponding issue), as well as possible deviations from the task. Do not tag or assign anyone to the issue. Even if the completion of the task is low, close the corresponding issue to let the evaluator know that something has been done in that task.
4. Create topic branches for individual parts of the work and use merge-requests. Working in small and independent increments will help you not messing up with the repository.
5. Remember that the evaluation will be done only on the basis of your `main` branch. No other branch will be considered for evaluation.
5. There is no need to modify or document your developments in this `README.md` file.
